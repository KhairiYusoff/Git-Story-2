Track your progress:

Tracking your progress is an extremely essential step. You must maintain a separate journal which tracks what you did your code/practice today.

When you donâ€™t maintain a journal, you become delusional about your progress.

You think you have done a lot but in reality you have not.

This journal will act like your roadmap and show you where exactly you at and where you are headed.

Stop reading answers right now and get to code.
