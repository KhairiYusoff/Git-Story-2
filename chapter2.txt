Take action:

If you are really serious about programming then you should start working towards it immediately.

I get approached by a lot of beginners who have a keen interest to learn programming but they never really start.

The more sooner you take action, the more sooner you reap the rewards.

The more you procrastinate, the more your rewards will be delayed.

When you take action instead of reading about stuff, it will give you a head start.
